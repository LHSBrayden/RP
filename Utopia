HISTORY
[spoiler]
At the beginning of time, none existed, none but the mighty Creators. There were ten beings, each harnessing unfathomable powers (Life, Death, War, Peace, Intelligence, Time, Construction, Destruction, Good, and Evil.). In order to keep balance, the beings divided their powers among themselves. Yet, their was who refused to share even a hint of power, he became known as the Titan, whilst the others are now referred to as the Gods.

The Gods came together to create the perfect life, a universe teeming with creatures. After finishing most of their creations, they noticed something was missing, "the perfect race". To fix this, the Gods created Earth, and filled it with beings of create power, Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Giants, whatever the mind could imagine. The God of Intelligence and the God of Construction imbued these races with the bare essentials they needed, after years of primal tribes and distraught, the two Gods decided to advance the races. After this advancement was made, the God of Time created the Sun and the Moon.

These races grew at an alarming rate, far exceeding the expectations of the Gods. They built cities, kingdoms, nations, all with great speed. They began referring to themselves as, "The Infinite Empire", in present days they are commonly believed to be a myth. Now with unlimited resources at their hand, the Infinite Empire seemed to be unstoppable, yet they kept a peaceful and calm nation. Their government had no signs of corruption, politics were fair among all, and the people had a say in everything.
